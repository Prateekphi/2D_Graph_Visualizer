# Welcome to 2D-Graph Visualizer Window

How it Works-

* Create an CSV file that contains the co-ordinates whose line graph will be plotted here.
	* In CSV, you should mention the x-coordinates in column A and y-coordinates in column B.
	* Do not give the indexing of coordinates, just put x and y values.
* OR you may create a TXT file also
	* write x and y coordinates separated by <spacebar> in each line for subsequent points
* Copy file path of the created (CSV or TXT) and paste it in section below.
	* Remember to put double back slashes ( \\ ) in place of every single back slash ( \ ).
* Press [Open file] Button.
* Boom! - Your graph is ready.
* At [File] tab in ~MenuBar there are multiple functionalities for "New" , "Home" , "Exit" , "Close All" also.
	* Note : "Home" Button actually opens a new window and your current work is closed.
