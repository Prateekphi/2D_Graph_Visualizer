How it Works-

* Create an CSV file wich will conatain some co-ordinates whose line graph will be plotted here
	* In CSV you will mention x-coordinates in A column and y-coordinates in B column
	* No need give indexing of coordinates , Just put x,y values
* Copy file path of CSV you created and paste it in below section
	* Remember to put double back slashes ( \\ ) in place of every single back slash ( \ ).
* Press [Open file] Button.
* Boom! - Your graph is ready.
* At [File] tab in ~MenuBar there are multiple functionalities for "New" , "Home" , "Exit" also.
	* Note : "Home" Button actually opens a new window and all your old work is closed.
